# Hannds-On-Introduction-to-Google-Sheets
By now, you have been introduced to spreadsheets and their role in data analysis. In this activity, you will work with a spreadsheet in Google Sheets.
Hands-On Activity: Introduction to Google Sheets.
In this activity, you will work with a spreadsheet in Google Sheets. You will create and edit a spreadsheet, share the sheet with others, and add comments to the sheet. Google Sheets is a cloud-based spreadsheet application. You can use Sheets to organize and analyze data from any online device. All the changes you make are automatically saved in the cloud.

By the time you complete this activity, you will be more familiar with some of the key features of Google Sheets. Knowing how to work with spreadsheet applications is an essential skill for any data analyst. Spreadsheets are powerful tools because they let you store, organize, analyze, and share data.

Step1.
There are many excellent spreadsheet applications available to data analysts, such as Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, and more. This activity uses Google Sheets. If you want to follow along with a different spreadsheet application, the steps will be similar.

If you want to use Google Sheets, you will need a Google account. If you don’t yet have a Google account, you can follow the instructions from the
Google account support page
. Once you have your Google account set up, you can start working with Google Sheets!

Step2
To start, go to
www.google.com

Click the Google Apps icon.
Then, click the Sheets icon.
Step4
In the Start a new spreadsheet section, click Blank to create a new blank spreadsheet.

Now you’ve got a new spreadsheet that you can use to enter your data!

For this activity, you want to create a spreadsheet that contains sales data for a local bakery. Here’s an example of the spreadsheet you will create:

After you create your sheet, give it a title. In the upper left corner of your sheet, click Untitled spreadsheet and enter a title. Make your title clear and concise. It should describe what the data in the spreadsheet is about. For example, you could use the title Bakery Sales March 2020 or something similar.

Next, enter your column headers. The first row of the spreadsheet is for data attributes, which is another name for column headers. An attribute is a characteristic or quality of data used to label a column in a table. It's basically labeling the type of data in each column. In this case, you want to enter data for transaction date, product name, price, and quantity. Click in cell A1 and enter your first header: Date. Click in cell B1 and enter your next header: Name. Repeat this process for the rest of the attributes.

Next, format your column headings to make them stand out clearly. For example, you can make the headings stand out from the rest of the rows by using bold and center alignment. Click on cell A1 and drag the handle across to cell D1 (you have now selected the range A1:D1). Next, click the bold icon on the toolbar. Then, click the Center align icon on the toolbar.

Now, enter relevant data for each column (Date, Name, Price, Quantity). Feel free to use the data contained in the example above, or create your own.

If you want to add another column between two existing columns, you can insert a new column. First, click on a column to select it. Then, click Insert on the menu bar and choose where to add the column. You can do the same thing to insert rows.

If you want to move an existing row or column, click the row number or column letter to select it. Then, drag it to a new location.

If you want to delete an existing row or column, right-click on the row number or column letter that you want to delete. Then, select Delete in the popup menu.

(Optional) Feel free to explore some of the other features in Google Sheets. Later on, we’ll cover many of these features in detail. For example, you can click Insert on the menu bar and experiment with charts, images, drawings, and more.

As mentioned earlier, your data is saved automatically as you are working.

Step4
Now that you’ve set up your spreadsheet, share it with others.

Collaborating with team members is an important part of being a data analyst. When you collaborate, people can make changes at the same time, and you can see their changes as they happen.

In Google Sheets, you can only share files that you own or have edit access to. Because you created your spreadsheet, you are the default owner.

To start, click the Share icon.
Under Share with people and groups in the pop-up window, enter the email address of your collaborator.
In Google Sheets, users have different access privileges. As the owner of the sheet, you can choose the access level for your collaborators. Click Editor in the dropdown and choose the access level:
Can edit—collaborators can add and edit content or comments. Choose this access level if you want them to be able to make changes to your spreadsheet.

Can comment—collaborators can add comments, but can't edit content. Choose this level if you just want their feedback.

Can view—collaborators can view the file, but cannot edit or add comments. Choose this level if you want to share a spreadsheet as an optional resource and you don’t need feedback.
(Optional) By default, Google Sheets will send an email notification to the person or group you share your spreadsheet with to let them know they now have access. You can add a note to that email by entering your text in the Message box. For example, you may want to include a description of what data your spreadsheet contains and why you want that person to check it out. If you don’t want to send an email notification, uncheck the Notify People box. This is particularly useful during documentation, when you don’t need people to review your work right away, but may want them to in the future.

Click Send.

Step5
You can send other people a link to a file or folder so that anyone with the link can open it. This is useful when you want to share your file or folder with a large group and do not want to type in everyone’s email addresses. You can share files that you own or have edit access to.

To start, click the Share icon.

In the Get link section of the pop-up window, you’ll notice that the default is Restricted so that only users with whom you’ve shared the file or folder via email can access it.

But, if you want to allow others to access your file or folder without having to add their email addresses, click Change.
By default, your organization is selected. Now choose an access level.

Click the Copy link.

Click Done.

Step6.
Paste the link in an email or any place you want to share it. If the recipient is in your organization, they will be able to access your file or folder without you having to grant them individual access.

You can also stop sharing a spreadsheet that you own at any time. You may want to do this if someone switches jobs or teams and should no longer be looking at your data.

To start, click the Share icon.

Click on the dropdown menu that shows the access level for the person you want to stop sharing the file with, then click Remove.

Finally, click Save.

Step7
Google Sheets lets you and your collaborators add comments to your sheet and reply to those comments. As a data analyst, this is a great way to share feedback with your teammates.

In your sheet, select the cell or cells you'd like to comment on.

Do one of the following:

Right-click on the cell and click on Comment in the pop-up menu.

Or click the Comment icon in the menu bar at the top of your sheet.

Next, enter your comment in the box.
(Optional) To direct your comment to a specific person, enter an at sign (@) followed by their email address. You can add as many people as you want. Each person will get an email with your comment and a link to the spreadsheet file. If that person does not currently have access to your file, Google Sheets will notify you in a pop-up window and ask if you want to grant that user access..

(Optional) To assign the comment to a specific person, check the Assign to box.

Finally, click Comment or Assign.
